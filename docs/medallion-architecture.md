# 🥉🥈🏅 Medallion Architecture Overview

The Medallion Architecture is a design pattern for organizing data lakes or data platforms into multiple layers that improve data quality and manageability progressively:

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer**: The raw ingestion layer, where data is captured in its original format without transformations. This data is often immutable and serves as the single source of truth.
- 🥈 **Silver Layer**: The cleaned and enriched layer, where data is transformed, normalized, and standardized. This layer makes data more usable for analysis and downstream processing.
- 🥇 **Gold Layer**: The aggregated and curated layer, designed for business-level consumption. Data here is typically aggregated, joined, and optimized for reporting, dashboards, or machine learning.

This layered approach helps ensure data quality, improves pipeline modularity, and supports scalable, maintainable data processing workflows.
